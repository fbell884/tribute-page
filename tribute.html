          <h4>
            High School Career (1999-2003):
          </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              LeBron played basketball and football for St. Vincent-St. Mary
              High School where he grew up in Akron, Ohio
            </li>
            <li>
              As a freshman, he averaged 21 points and 6 rebounds to lead his
              team to a perfect 27-0 record and state championship
            </li>
            <li>
              By his junior year, he averaged 29 points a game and was featured
              on the cover of Sports Illustrated at just 17 years old. He was
              also the first junior to be named male basketball Gatorade
              National Player of the Year.
            </li>
            <li>
              After his senior year, he decided to skip college and become the
              number one draft pick in the 2003 NBA draft
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="item2">
          <h4>
            First Stint with Cleveland (2003-2010)
          </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              James' posted 25 points in his NBA debut, the most by any
              prep-to-pro player. He eventually won the Rookie of the Year award
              for the 2003-2004 season.
            </li>
            <li>
              In his sophomore season (2004-2005), he earned his first of many
              consecutive all-star appearances.
            </li>
            <li>
              James won his first All-Star Game MVP during the 2006 all-star
              game.
            </li>
            <li>
              During the 2007 playoffs against the Detroit Pistons, James scored
              29 of Cleveland's last 30 points to win the game. In these same
              playoffs, at 22 years old, LeBron took what some say "the worst
              team ever" to the NBA finals, which they eventually lost in 4
              games.
            </li>
            <li>
              He won his first NBA Most Valuable Player award in 2009. He then
              won his second in 2010. Despite these personal accomplishments,
              winning a championship was still a void for him in his career.
            </li>
            <li>
              On July 8, 2010, James went on national television and announced
              he was taking his talents to Miami to link up with other NBA stars
              Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="item3">
          <h4>
            Miami Heat (2010-2014)
          </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Upon "The Decision" many people criticized James for going to
              Miami to link up with two All-Stars.
            </li>
            <li>
              Despite starting off slow in the 2010-2011 season, the Heat went
              on to the NBA finals but ultimately lost in 6 games to the Dallas
              Mavericks.
            </li>
            <li>
              The 2011-2012 season brought LeBron James his 3rd MVP award and
              his first ever NBA Championship trophy. He was also named Finals
              MVP for the first time.
            </li>
            <li>
              The 2012-2013 season brought LeBron his 4th MVP award and his
              second NBA championship. He was then named Finals MVP for the
              second time.
            </li>
            <li>
              After the 2014 Finals loss to the San Antonio Spurs, LeBron
              decided to leave the Miami Heat and return to the Cleveland
              Cavaliers
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="item4">
          <h4>
            Second Stint with Cleveland (2014-2018)
          </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              LeBron went back to Cleveland to play with two budding stars in
              Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love.
            </li>
            <li>
              James reached the NBA Finals for the 6th time in 2015, but due to
              injuries to Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love, his extremely dominant
              performance could not propel him past the Golden State Warriors.
            </li>
            <li>
              He met the Warriors in the NBA finals for his 7th stint in 2016
              (6th consecutive) and ended up being down 3 games to 1 to the
              Warriors. Despite this, James continued to have one of the
              greatest finals performances of all time and lead his team to the
              first 3-1 comback in finals history. He won his 3rd NBA
              championship and his 3rd Finals MVP.
            </li>
            <li>
              James met the Warriors in the Finals for the next two seasons
              again, but after NBA Superstar Kevin Durant signed with the
              already-powerhouse Warriors, James lost the finals to them in
              consecutive seasons. His performances remained absolutely
              dominant, but the Cavs did not have the team personnel to beat
              them.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="item5">
          <h4>
            Los Angeles Lakers (2018-Present)
          </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              James ultimately left Cleveland and decided to move out to the
              warm weather in LA and play with some young, budding stars. After
              a surprisingly good start with this team and being 4th in the
              western conference, James sustained a groin injury and the Lakers
              lost their playoff chances for the 2018-2019 season.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Lakers traded for NBA superstar Anthony Davis in the 2019
              season and this moved LeBron to a permenant point guard role.
            </li>
            <li>
              Many people were suprised when LeBron lead the Lakers to a 17-2
              start in his 17th NBA season, the best in Lakers franchise
              history.
            </li>
            <li>
              On January 25, 2020, LeBron passed the late-great Kobe Bryant for
              3rd on the NBA's all time scoring list.
            </li>
            <li>
              The NBA was suspended on March 11, 2020 due to the Coronavirus
              Pandemic, which brings many unknown questions to how the rest of
              LeBron's legacy will play out.
